## FAQ
### Who is this project for?

This Data Management Templates Project is aimed to anyone create and distribute various types of documents. Our templates can be used for any research projects, large and small, of any disciplines.

Whomever is responsible for data management decisions in the project, will probably be the one interested in using our templates. In many cases this person will be the Principal Investigator with the help of the research team. In large projects it may be a data manager. A grad student in charge of his/her research project may want to use this too.

We have tried to make these templates as general as possible. It is possible that these templates will fit some fields more than others. If you have feedback to give us open an issue or send us an e-mail to [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu), we are very interested in hearing whether this is useful for you!

### Is there a Data Management Plan template?

No, this is a project does not include a template. A Data Management Plan is a document that many funding agencies require be submitted with grant proposals. This template assumes that you already have a Data Management Plan, and need to create supplementary documents.

### How can I get help to write my own Data Management Plan?
If you need help to write a Data Management Plan you can:
- Find guidance in [DMPTool.org](https://dmptool.org/)
- Find guidance in [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)
- Find guidance at the library of your institution. Many institutions have wonderful guidance in their websites, and librarians that can help you to write a Data Management Plan.
- If you are a researcher of Oregon State University, you can contact Research Data Services at [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)

### I have a Data Management Plan, why do I need these other documents?
Data Management Plans are often submitted with grant proposals. Thus, these plans are written generally, as many details about day to day data management are still not known.

The goal of this template is both to help research groups make concrete and specific decisions about data management practices, and to make it a living document that can be updated and consulted often.

### Do I need to publish my documents using GitHub?

No, it does not need to be in GitHub. There are a few reasons why we have decided to host these templates GitHub:
- Because you can easily clone our templates, edit them, and have a website with your Data Management Plan Implementation. Having a public Data Management Plan Implementation or other documents in the form of a website will help your research group because it will make your practices transparent, and because everybody in your research group will be able to consult them easily from wherever they are.
- Because it is a tool that many researchers are already familiar with. If you are not one of these researchers, we have created guidelines to help you through the process.
- Because you can edit websites with Markdown. You do not need to know html or other programming languages. Markdown is generally intuitive and easy to learn for most researchers. We have also included a [few guidelines for Markdown editing](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) in this template, just in case.

However, there are many reasons why GitHub may not be the right choice for a research project. This template is also accessible as a Word document, a pdf, and a LaTeX document.

### Can I use Github without using Github Pages?
Yes! Github Pages allows your documents to appear as webpages but simply hosting Github without pages also works. This maybe a better option if there are concerns about the privacy of your information.  

### Your templates does not fit very well with my discipline.

Please, let us know! Write us an e-mail at [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu) or open an issue. We may be able to improve the templates in the future.

These templates can be changed as much as you need, so hopefully this will still be somewhat useful to help implement create the documents for your research project.

### What if I don't have a Data Management Plan?
The assumption of this Data Management Plan Implementation Template is that you have a Data Management Plan that you want to implement. This is the case of many research projects because many funding agencies require data management plans to be submitted with grant proposals. But if this is not your case, you can still use this template! We actually really encourage you to do so. Go ahead and start editing!

### I am a grad student. Can I use these templates?

Yes. Data Management Plans are absolutely useful for masters research projects or for PhD research projects. We encourage you to write a Data Management Plan, whether you use this template or not! It is most useful to write a Data Management Plan at the beginning of your project, but it will still be useful at other more advanced stages of the project.

### I have feedback for you.

Excellent! Please open an issue with the feedback or send an e-mail to [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu). We appreciate your time doing that!

### How do I acknowledge that I am using your templates?

These templates are published under a CC0 license. You are not expected to give attribution, but we will apreciate it if you do. You can include a line to your Data Management Plan or to the readme of your repository saying "This DMP has been generated using the template developed by Clara Llebot Lorente and Mark Landon, working for Research Data Services at the Oregon State University Library. https://github.com/landonma/Data-Managment-Templates-Project"

### I need help!

If you need help to write the implementation of your Data Management Plan you can:
- Find guidance at the library of your institution. Many institutions have wonderful guidance in their websites, and librarians that can help you to write a Data Management Plan.
- If you are a researcher of Oregon State University, you can contact Research Data Services at [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)
- If you can't find help in your institution and you are not part of Oregon State University you can send us an e-mail. We may be able to help with general guidance, although we cannot offer in depth advice to researchers not belonging to Oregon State University.

### In what other formats can I find this template?

We also offer this template in Word, pdf and LaTeX.

### I don't want my data management documents to be openly available. How can I use this template?

You can still use our template documents for creating your own. You should **NOT** use Github Pages and should only use Github **IF** your repository is private.


### Will I find these templates useful if I am not from OSU?

We have writen these templates as generally as possible so that they are useful to the maximum number of people. However, the guidance documents have been written with Oregon State University in mind, so that they are especially useful for researchers of that institution. If you have suggestions about how to improve the templates or the guidance documents so that they are more broadly useful, please open an issue or send an e-mail to [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)
