2. Birds Census   
   - Spreadsheets with counts of migratory birds
   - Photographs and videos with geo-location tags
3. Water quality
   - instrumentation (dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, temperature, nutrients, etc)
   - lab data: phytoplankton and zooplankton species identification
   - spreadsheet, physical samples, photos and microscope images
4. Use of the wetlands as a recreational site
   - Interviews of visitors on how they use the wetlands and its value

## Data Documentation
###### *Instructions*  
*[Describe how data will be documented throughout the project]*

###### *Text*  
Data will be documented throughout the research process using the following tools:

**Lab notebooks:**

Details about experiments and work in a lab are quickly forgotten unless they are written down. Be diligent in writing information into notebooks. Follow best practices:  
- Lab notebooks will always be bound notebooks. Blank notebooks can be found in *[blank]*. Number and date the notebook when you begin with a new one.  
-	Pages should always be numbered.
-	Write legibly and in a language understood by everybody in the lab.
-	Error correction: incorrect information should be visible, but clearly marked as incorrect.  Date, sign and explain the correction. Do not erase entries or blot them out.
-	Printed documentation added to the lab notebook should be attached permanently.
-	Note where all electronic files associated with the experiment are located.
-	All entries should be consecutive. Always record dates.
-	Backup: at the end of the day *[blank]* [scan, photographâ€¦] the pages of the notebook that you worked on, and store them in *[blank]*

**Templates:** survey,   

**Readme:** *[If the project will be documented using readme files, include expectations about where they will be created, and which information will be recorded in them.]*  

##### Rationale and resources



## Quality Control
###### *Instructions*    
*[Most data need to go through a quality control process. Describe the process here, and describe how it will be documented. For ideas around defining levels of quality control, see the Guidance Document.]*
##### Rationale and resources
It may be useful to design different levels of quality control. For example:

**Level zero (L0):** Data as it is downloaded directly from an instrument or model. This data is often in binary format, impossible to understand or look at by a human unless it is processed by a program. These programs tend to be proprietary and they may or may not perform operations on the data. This data level may not exist. For example: binary files coming from a temperature sensor permanently installed in a stream.  

**Level one (L1):** Raw data in a format that is understandable by a human. There have been no corrections on these data. For example, a csv file obtained after running the programs supplied by the company that manufactured the instrument.  

**Level two (L2):** Verified data that have undergone quality control, including but not limited to:
*	Detecting sensor malfunctioning
*	Assessment of outliers
*	Calibration
*	Corrections for sensor drift or offset, data artifacts, etc.

Level two data are the best data that a researcher could use. Level two data should not include data that have undergone quality control procedures that are subjective to the researcher. When quality control is not necessary, L1 and L2 data may be the same.  

**Level three (L3):** L2 data that have been analyzed to answer specific research questions. Typically, this is the data that will be used to create figures in a publication. For example, if a principal component analysis was used to analyze three years of temperature data and published in a figure as part of a peer-reviewed article.  




## File Organization

###### *Instructions*    
*[Details about the organization of data files in shared or privatefolders. What name to give to  folders? What kind of filesshould be savedin each folder?Design file naming techniques so that file names are informative for all files, and consistent throughout the folders, regardless of the person creating the file.]*

Lab material must be connectable to their context in the real world (lab notebook, instrument settings, etc.). Proper lab data management will ensure this is possible.

- The directory containing experimental output should have the following format:
YYYY-MM-DD_notebook-page_descriptive-name
- The raw experimental data should be exported into an appropriate non-proprietary, long-term file format.
- Each directory should have a clearly labeled summary file (image, text file/document, or graph). The summary file should be printed out and placed in the lab notebook.



## Formats
###### *Instructions*    
*[Describe preferred formatsto save information and data. Describe situations in which files should be changed from one format to a different one.See the guidance document for a list of preferred formats for long term preservation.]*

##### Rationale and resources

Formats that will be better at long term preservation are formats that are platform independent (can be accessed from Linux, Mac and Windows), in an open format (no proprietary formats), and character based (not in binary format). There can be exceptions to all of these for the right reasons. For example, some data standards that are widely used in some disciplines, like netCDFs, save data in binary format.  
See [eCommons: Cornell's Digital Repository. Recommended file formats](http://guides.library.cornell.edu/ecommons/formats) for a table with existing formats for different types of content, and their probability for full term preservation.



## Storage  



## Backup



## Workflow Internal Data Sharing
Rationale: setting expectations about how and when datasets will be shared internally will minimize conflict during the project.


- The meteorological dataset will be made available to everyone involved with the project on the shared drive at the following location; R:\projects\BrBoMaster\Metero\. The data will be available in csv format accompanied by XML documents which adhere to EML metadata standards. Datasets will be consistently updated and calibrated throughout the project by Martha Marien. As datasets are updated, no notification will be given. Raw data will only be uploaded if there are no processed version and otherwise can be requested by emailing Martha Marien.


- The bird survey dataset will be made available to everyone involved with the project on the shared drive at the following location; R:\projects\BrBoMaster\Birds. The dataset will be available in CSV format accompanied by text files which include the metadata. Datasets will be uploaded within two weeks of data collection by the individual who collected it.. The first survey will be conducted in March and the second in May. Email notifications will be sent when the new datasets are uploaded. !!Level 2 !!


- The water quality datasets will be made available to everyone involved with the project on the shared drive at the following location; R:\projects\BrBoMaster\WaterQ. !! water quality data format !! Datasets will



## Data Use



## Protection for Sensitive and Confidential Data



## Management of Physical Samples



## Data Publication

##### Acknowledgment of Data Use

All members of the Project involved in roles related to data management will be acknowledged in some way. Specifically:

Members of the Project that were involved in data generation will be offered co-authorship to papers that make use of their data. This offer is required for any publications with data that is formally unpublished. After the first publication of a dataset this convention is not mandatory but is highly encouraged for the two years following the project's completion. Co-authorship will require participation in the interpretation of the data, writing, or critical review of the manuscript, approval of the final manuscript. The offer for co-authorship may be accepted or declined. When students (PhD or masters) accept co-authorship, the initiators of the article will commit to provide support and mentorship to the student, so that their role can be meaningful.

Datasets will be published separately from the research in a repository on OSU's Scholars Archive. Members of the Project with a significant data management contribution will be listed as co-authors in the data publication. Every member of the Project that makes use of the published datasets will cite the dataset and list it in the reference list in their publications.

When possible, publications will be made in journals that use the CRediT authorship taxonomy (http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT) or similar. The roles of each of the members of the Project involved in data management will be documented using the appropriate roles. Members of the Project involved in data analysis will be acknowledged in the acknowledgment section in papers and publications. ó „€
