# The Data Management Templates Project

## Summary
In this collection of repositories you will find templates that will help you create several data management documents. This repository explains the project, discusses each template and gives you the tools to complete these templates. This projects help you create the following three documents:
* Data Management Implementation Plan
* Data Internal Sharing Plan
* Data Documentation File (README)

## Context of the project
Many funding agencies require the Principal Investigator to submit a Data Management Plan with grant applications. The Data Management Plan is usually a two page document in which the researcher makes a plan for how the research data generated or used during the project will be managed. The Data Management Plan document is created at the beginning stages of a project, is general in scope, and isn't updated once the project starts. !!


 The goal of having these templates in Github is to make it easily available to all the researchers in your group, and to make it a living document, where you can document changes as necessary. The goal of this project is to help researchers manage their data by creating documentation about how their research data will be managed. We provide templates, instructions with tools and resources, and examples to make these documents as easy as possible to generate. The templates are:

## Templates

### 1. Data Management Implementation Plan  
This template will help researchers take a Data Management Plan created in the proposal stages of a grant, and implement it. The goal is that this document will have specific guidelines to help the researchers in the project to manage data in a coordinated manner. This should be a living document that can be updated during the project as much as it is needed.

### 2. Internal Data Sharing Plan

Disagreements between the members of a team regarding the sharing of research data during the project is a common occurrence. This Internal Data Sharing Plan is designed so that researchers will make decisions about data sharing and data attribution at the beginning of the project, to minimize disagreements down the road. This document makes sure everyone has the information they need to decide when and how to share data internally.

### 3. Documentation File

A Documentation File (sometimes referred to as README file)  has information about datasets that are made publicly available in data repositories. This document ensures that others have all the information they need to understand and potentially reuse the data, it identifies the authors of the dataset so that they can be contacted if needed, and clarify the terms of use of the data.
