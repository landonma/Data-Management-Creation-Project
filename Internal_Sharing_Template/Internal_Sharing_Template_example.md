## SECTION I: DATA MANAGEMENT

### A) Project overview  
This agreement is between all the members of the Health and Value of the Brian Booth Wetlands Project. Throughout this document we will refer to it as the Project.  

This project is a collaboration between five groups, each creating a different dataset. The five data sets are:   

D1. Meteorological Data,  
D2. Bird Census,  
D3. Water Quality Records,  
D4. Use of Wetlands Survey  
D5. Map Generation

### B) Data Management Plan (DMP)  
The data management plan for the Project can be found in the shared R drive at "R:\projects\BrBoMaster\DMPMaster\DMP_latest.doc".

### C) Data Description  
The aim of the project is use a wide range of disciplines to look at function and health of the Brian Booth Wetlands which lies along the Central Oregon Coast. To do this, 12 people from 5 departments and one government agency will collect five datasets looking at different aspects of the same area. The datasets are as follow:

1. Meteorological data  
    - Readings from a station set up for the duration of the project (temperature, wind speed, humidity, ect)
2. Birds Census   
   - Spreadsheets with counts of migratory birds
   - Photographs and videos with geo-location tags
3. Water quality
   - instrumentation (dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, temperature, nutrients, etc)
   - lab data: phytoplankton and zooplankton species identification
   - spreadsheet, physical samples, photos and microscope images
4. Use of the wetlands as a recreational site
   - Interviews of visitors on how they use the wetlands and its value
5. Maps
   - Maps of the area that provide context for the project

## SECTION III: ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DATA USE

All members of the Project involved in roles related to data management will be acknowledged in some way. Specifically:

Members of the Project that were involved in data generation will be offered co-authorship to papers that make use of their data. This offer is required for any publications with data that is formally unpublished. After the first publication of a dataset this convention is not mandatory but is highly encouraged for the two years following the project's completion. Co-authorship will require participation in the interpretation of the data, writing, or critical review of the manuscript, approval of the final manuscript. The offer for co-authorship may be accepted or declined. When students (PhD or masters) accept co-authorship, the initiators of the article will commit to provide support and mentorship to the student, so that their role can be meaningful.

Datasets will be published separately from the research in a repository on OSU's Scholars Archive. Members of the Project with a significant data management contribution will be listed as co-authors in the data publication. Every member of the Project that makes use of the published datasets will cite the dataset and list it in the reference list in their publications.

When possible, publications will be made in journals that use the CRediT authorship taxonomy (http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT) or similar. The roles of each of the members of the Project involved in data management will be documented using the appropriate roles. Members of the Project involved in data analysis will be acknowledged in the acknowledgment section in papers and publications. 󠄀

### SECTION IV: WORKFLOWS

### A) Data access, permissions, and restriction
Datasets will be shared internally at minimum with all people listed in this document. The meteorological data, bird survey, water quality data and maps will be shared with all members on the shared drive. Remote access to the server will be provide to Dianne Dunning so that she can access the data on her work computer. All tabular data will be shared as comma separated values (csv) files. The maps will be available as shapefiles as well as a geodatabase. Any image or video files should be shared in their original format (jpeg and mp4 are preferred).

The meteorological dataset will be made available continuously through out the project. This dataset will be updated with the latest calibration versions available. There will be updated quality control information, based on defined quality levels (L0 raw data, L1 has passed tests A and B, L2 has passed all tests. Description of protocols and tests are in the R drive ("R:\projects\BrBoMaster\Metero\tests\testdescriptions.txt"). Updates will be regular and no notifications will be sent for each version. The latest version will always be on the top level of the meteorological folder along with the version number.

The bird survey data will be made available within two weeks of surveys conduction. Any versions after the raw data should be clearly denoted and available in the same location. If any substantial changes are made to the dataset an email should be sent to all members of the project outlining the changes.!! add verions control detials

The wetlands survey will only be shared as a de-identified dataset to everyone except Diane Dunning and Barbra Hubble. This dataset will be shared after all the surveys are complete and processed. The raw data will only be available when it is deemed appropriate through special request from Diane Dunning. Diane Dunning will send an email to only those people using the survey dataset if there are changes after the initial upload and provided documentation in the wetland survey's readme.

The water quality dataset will be made available periodically as the water samples are processed. The raw results and the processed data will both be available on the shared drive. The collection and processing dates will be clearly indicated on the files.
!! contancet person reposible for subproject for publication before they publish theirs

The maps are available for any members to access on the R drive. This data is also available to the public via Scholars Archive (https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/datasets/b3d8tfccd). No additional maps are planned for this project.

### B) Data storage
Datasets will be shared with the OSU faculty, team members, and students through the R-drive (R:\projects\BrBoMaster).


### C) Confidentiality
The measures for establishing safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the data among the researchers in this Project are *[Complete. Feel free to refer to the DMP for detailed description of the confidentiality measures]*. This helps prevent unauthorized use or access to the data and limiting access to data for authorized staff.
!! only the wetlands, IRB approvals was obtained and can be accessed in paht....
Researchers using data that they have not generated should discuss with authors of the data possible publication dates.

### D) Other workflows
*[Include other workflow details that will be useful if necessary. For example, there may be details in the data management plan that can be outlined or detailed here. For example, when will the datasets be made publicly available? Who will decide when to make the dataset available if there are several researchers working with them?]*.

When a new version of a dataset is created by a group that did not generate the original dataset:
- Communicate with original authors and explain
- Share with all, following the standards described here. Document any important information that both sides want to share about the new dataset.
!! project folder structure R drive iwht picture
!! publication 2 years or first aricle project using the data

## SECTION V: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERNAL DATA SHARING PLAN

### A) Duration of Agreement
This internal data sharing plan is effective from 2019-01-20 through 2020-05-31.

### B) Internal Data Sharing Plan update
This plan may be amended, modified, or updated. While Bethany Barnard will make the ultimate decision about changes; Rick Rogers, Sam Singer, Wallace Williams and Diane Dunning will be consulted. All members of the teams should be informed and trained (if applicable) on changes.
