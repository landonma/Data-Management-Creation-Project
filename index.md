# The Data Management Templates Project

## Summary
In this collection of repositories you will find templates that will help you create several data management documents. This repository explains the project, discusses each template and gives you the tools to complete these templates. This projects help you create the following three documents:
* Data Management Implementation Plan
* Data Internal Sharing Plan
* Data Documentation File (README)

## Context of the project
Many funding agencies require the Principal Investigator to submit a Data Management Plan with grant applications. The Data Management Plan is usually a two page document in which the researcher makes a plan for how the research data generated or used during the project will be managed. The Data Management Plan document is created at the beginning stages of a project, is general in scope, and isn't updated once the project starts. !!


This template attempts to be a list of things that you will probably want to think about, regarding data management, before and during the research project. The goal of having this template in Github is to make it easily available to all the researchers in your group, and to make it a living document, where you can document changes as necessary.   

## Suggested use of this template

You can take this template and use it as you want. It is published under a CC0 license. However, this is how we think it is most useful:

* Once your grant has been awarded: pass the information from the Data Management Plan submitted with the grant proposal to this template. During this process, make data management practices specific so that they can be useful in the day-to-day in the lab. You can involve other members of the team who weren't involved in the grant writing process.
* At the beginning of the project: use it to involve other researchers in data management decisions.
* During your project: use it as a reference document to train new researchers that get involved in the research project..
* During the project: use it to document changes in any of the data management practices followed by the group.
* At the end of your research project: use it to document your compliance with funders requirements related to data management.
* At the end of the project: use it to inform the data management plan of your new grant proposal.
* Before, during and after your project: make your research more transparent by making your research data management practices publicly available.
